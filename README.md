# Predicting CO2 Emissions

This project focuses on analysing and predicting global CO2 emissions using machine learning techniques. It utilises the "Global Data on Sustainable Energy (2000-2020)" dataset from Kaggle to explore various factors influencing CO2 emissions and develop predictive models.

## Project Overview

- **Data Source**: Global Data on Sustainable Energy (2000-2020) from Kaggle
- **Main Libraries Used**: NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Key Features**: Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualisation, and predictive modelling

## Key Components

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Handling missing values
   - Renaming columns for clarity
   - Converting data types for analysis

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analysing distribution of variables
   - Identifying correlations between different factors and CO2 emissions
   - Visualising trends and patterns in the data

3. **Data Visualisation**:
   - Histograms of key variables
   - Box plots for CO2 emissions and related factors

4. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Description of the machine learning models used
   - Evaluation metrics and results

## Insights

This project provides insights into global energy consumption patterns, renewable energy adoption, and their relationship with CO2 emissions. It aims to contribute to understanding the factors influencing global carbon emissions and potential strategies for mitigation.

## Future Work

- Implement advanced machine learning models for CO2 emission prediction
- Incorporate more recent data to capture current trends
- Explore the impact of policy changes on emission patterns
